create 2d grid
    we don't know the size so...make it really big??
create track list to remember intersection points
start at central port and draw line 1 and mark each point traversed on the grid
start at central port and draw line 2 and mark each point traversed on the grid. if the point has already been marked, add it to the track list
find entry in track list with shortest manhattan distance:
    |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|
